                    <p id="left-text"><span class="dropped-capital">S</span>ince the dawn of modern maximalism, it has been important to purchase your own goods from supermarkets, allowing
                        lonely housewifes and busy businessmen alike to complete their own dreams of cooking their very own and unqiue michelin-eque meal. However, the dawn of AI has changed this forever.</p>
                    <p><b>AI Shopping Assistants</b><br>With the rise of artificial intelligence, many supermarkets and online retailers have begun to implement AI shopping assistants. These assistants can help customers find products, suggest recipes based on available ingredients, and even create personalized shopping
                        lists. This has made shopping more efficient and enjoyable for many people.</p>
                    <p><b>Personalized Recommendations</b><br>AI algorithms analyze customer data to provide personalized product recommendations. By understanding individual preferences and shopping habits, AI can suggest items that customers are more likely to purchase, enhancing their shopping experience and increasing sales for retailers.</p>
                    <p><b>Data-Driven Offers</b><br>Large supermarkets like Tesco and M&S utilize their mobile apps to collect extensive user data, including purchase history, browsing patterns, and location information. This data feeds into AI systems that generate personalized offers, targeted discounts, and customized product suggestions delivered directly to customers' smartphones, creating a more tailored shopping experience.</p>

Smart shopping apps can suggest healthier food alternatives, track dietary requirements, and ensure seniors maintain balanced diets. Additionally, these systems can remind elderly users to purchase essential medications and health supplements, helping them maintain their independence while staying healthy.</p>
