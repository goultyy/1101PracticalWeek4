Adrian Wieclaw review (guy in the burgundy hoodie)

The index page is fine, although it could do with some extra styling
to make it stand out from the others and to make the headings/text better alligned.

For the individual pages, the news article style is nice however it would help to 
style it to fit wider screens (like the laptop I'm on right now) to make it more llegible.

Some feedback is to make folders to make the file structure here more manageable,
and add more features in future development to make the website more interesting to read. Overall
great progress so far though.
